    the weblink no longer works. I used firebase and after a while of inactivity, the notes were deleted from the database and it was disconnected from my project. You still able to see the rest of the feature, though.


This web app allows you to create notes and stores in in a Firebase backend, allowing you to access it even after clicking out. 
Features
    -Type notes title and create the note. 
    -Changeable note color, allowing you to organize yourself with color coding
    -Ability to filter notes using their colors: simply click on the color you want to see and it will show you all notes of that color
    -For the notes portion, you can add pictures or gifs- i used markdown to allow this
    -Resize the boxes, allows you to add more text/bigger pictures
    
    
 The web app has an overall sleek feel due to the color I chose and the design choices i made.
 I added a feature that gives the notes a "glow" of the same color, as you can see in the picture below. 
 Additionally, when you hove over a note, the glow changes to show you that you are over something clickable.
